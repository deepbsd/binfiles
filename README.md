# Dave's Binfiles  

These are just some files that I might use from day to day.  Or in some cases they're files
that others have created and I happen to be studying or playing with, as is the case with
eznix's Arch installers.  Although at this point I think I have created my own Arch install
ideas that seem to work well.  But I also might want to play with other ideas, such as
whiptail and dialog.  Will comment further as time goes by.  Normally, stuff I actually use a
lot would wind up in my *.bashrc* which is part of my dotfiles repo.  But sometimes I just want
to work on some ideas before I introduce them into day-to-day use.
