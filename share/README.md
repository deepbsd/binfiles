# What Is This?

I have some larger shell scripts that I need to break up into projects.  I'm
thinking of my Archtail script for installing Archlinux.  It's almost 800 lines now
and it's all in one file.  I need to find a way to organize these into smaller,
easier-to-maintain files.  I need to make the project more easily maintainable.
